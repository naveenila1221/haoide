# Project Configuration
## Workspace
If your operation system is **OSX**, you should change the workspace in ```HaoIDE``` > ```Setting``` > ```Setting - User``` to your own, if you didn't do that, plugin will save the project to ```<packages_path>/User/HaoIDE```, 

There are two tiers of workspace concept in this plugin, including plugin level workspace and project level workspace, the privilege of project level is higher than the plugin level workspace, if you didn't define the workspace in the project property of ```projects``` setting, plugin will set your plugin level workspace to the default workspace, for example, if the settings is set as below:

```javascript
{
    // Workspace in OSX is different with windows, 
    // workspace can be "/Users/<Your User>/salesforce/workspace"
    "workspace": "c:/salesforce/workspace1",
    "projects": {
        "pro-exercise": {
            "default": true,
            "login_url": "https://login.salesforce.com",
            "password": "******",
            "username": "mouse@exercise.com",
            "workspace": "c:/salesforce/workspace2",
        }
    }
}
```

Your plugin level workspace is ```c:/salesforce/workspace1```, your project level workspace is ```c:/salesforce/workspace2```, because you have defined your project level workspace, so the default workspace of ```pro-exercise``` project is ```c:/salesforce/workspace2```, however, if the settings is set as below,

```javascript
{
    // Workspace in OSX is different with windows, 
    // workspace can be "/Users/<Your User>/salesforce/workspace"
    "workspace": "c:/salesforce/workspace1",
    "projects": {
        "pro-exercise": {
            "default": true,
            "login_url": "https://login.salesforce.com",
            "password": "******",
            "username": "mouse@exercise.com",
            "workspace": "c:/salesforce/workspace2",
        },

        "sandbox-exercise": {
            "default": true,
            "login_url": "https://test.salesforce.com",
            "password": "******",
            "username": "mouse@exercise.com.qa"
        }
    }
}
```

Your plugin level workspace is ```c:/salesforce/workspace1```, because ```pro-exercise``` has its own workspace and ```sandbox-exercise``` doesn't have, so, the workspace of ```pro-exercise``` is ```c:/salesforce/workspace2```, the workspace of ```sandbox-exercise``` is ```c:/salesforce/workspace1```


## Projects
There is a default test org in this plugin, you can see it by clicking ```HaoIDE``` > ```Switch Project``` in the main menu, however, if you want to use this plugin in your own org, you need to configure your org user confidential before new project.

In order to prevent plugin update overriding your settings, you should keep your customize settings into ```Setting - User``` by clicking ```HaoIDE``` > ```Settings``` > ```Setting - User```.

You can setup your projects follow below sample by clicking ```HaoIDE``` > ```Settings``` > ```Setting - User``` in the main menu, projects must be included in {}.

When you initiate your settings, you can have more than one project in "projects", however, only one project default should be true.

    "projects": {

            "allowed_packages": []
        },
        "Project2 Name": {
            "default": false,
            "login_url": "https://test.salesforce.com",

```javascript
{
    // Workspace in OSX is different with windows, 
    // workspace can be "/Users/<Your User>/salesforce/workspace"
